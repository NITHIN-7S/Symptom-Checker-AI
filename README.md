# 🧠 SymptomCheckerAI — Smart Health Insight System

SymptomCheckerAI is an AI-powered health insight tool that helps users understand their symptoms instantly and responsibly. It analyzes natural language input, identifies possible conditions, provides severity levels, suggests precautions, and guides users toward informed next steps — all without giving medical diagnoses.

This project was developed collaboratively by **Sharief Sk** and a teammate.

## 🩺 What This Project Does

SymptomCheckerAI transforms raw user symptom descriptions into meaningful, structured insights. It focuses on:

* **Symptom Understanding:** Converts user text into medically relevant keywords.
* **Preliminary Condition Mapping:** Suggests *possible* conditions (not professional diagnoses).
* **Risk Categorization:** Ranks the concern level — mild, moderate, or urgent.
* **Precaution Guidelines:** Offers actionable preventive steps.
* **User-Friendly Output:** Clean UI and easy-to-understand results.

It’s designed as an **early guidance tool**, not a medical substitute.
